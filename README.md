# go-simple-calculator
A simple calculator in Go, similar to what I made in Rust [here](https://github.com/Irevle/rust-simple-calculator). It takes two numbers and an operand and it will give you the result. It can do addition, substraction, multiplication, and raise to a power.

For the go.mod, I don't intend to publish any libraries at all in this one. It is simply for practice, thus the naming without GitHub link.
